# Advent of Code 2021

This year I'm trying to solve them in Elixir using Livebook.

## Setup

Here's how I did it
Create a `.tool-versions` file

```
elixir 1.12.3-otp-24
erlang 24.1.7
```

then `asdf install`

after that

```
git clone https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook
```

and run instructions to install and run the master branch locally (needed to use the Kino tool that Jose Valim demos)
https://github.com/josevalim/aoc/tree/main/2021
